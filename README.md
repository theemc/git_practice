#Project Escape-86
##About Escape-86
I chose to create this project as a way to escape my current job and build a foundation to launch a future career that is not at building 86.

##Features
+Many miscellaneous mini-projects completed on Codecademy.
+Fun side projects I ventured into on my own
+Some other miscellenaeous challenges and projects from a book entitled *Eloquent JavaScript*

##Instructions
Well, uhhmmm. There really aren't any, so... yeah. As of now, most of these programs are simply run and logged to console. So, just put them in your favorite debugger and try them out!

##Technologies
1. JavaScript
  Most of the projects here (so far) are built in JavaScript.
2. HTML
  Works really well with JavaScript, so yeah.
3. CSS
  Works really well with HTML, so yeah.

##Collaborators
All coding on this project has been completed by myself, though I would like to thank my current place of employment for its ample motivation and support.
